## OpenAI-compatible Models

Many providers and models are compatible with the OpenAI API, and can be used with `OpenAIChatModel` in Pydantic AI. Before getting started, check the [installation and configuration](#install) instructions above.

To use another OpenAI-compatible API, you can make use of the `base_url` and `api_key` arguments from `OpenAIProvider`:

```python
from pydantic_ai import Agent
from pydantic_ai.models.openai import OpenAIChatModel
from pydantic_ai.providers.openai import OpenAIProvider

model = OpenAIChatModel(
    'model_name',
    provider=OpenAIProvider(
        base_url='https://<openai-compatible-api-endpoint>', api_key='your-api-key'
    ),
)
agent = Agent(model)
...

```

Various providers also have their own provider classes so that you don't need to specify the base URL yourself and you can use the standard `<PROVIDER>_API_KEY` environment variable to set the API key. When a provider has its own provider class, you can use the `Agent("<provider>:<model>")` shorthand, e.g. `Agent("deepseek:deepseek-chat")` or `Agent("moonshotai:kimi-k2-0711-preview")`, instead of building the `OpenAIChatModel` explicitly. Similarly, you can pass the provider name as a string to the `provider` argument on `OpenAIChatModel` instead of building instantiating the provider class explicitly.

#### Model Profile

Sometimes, the provider or model you're using will have slightly different requirements than OpenAI's API or models, like having different restrictions on JSON schemas for tool definitions, or not supporting tool definitions to be marked as strict.

When using an alternative provider class provided by Pydantic AI, an appropriate model profile is typically selected automatically based on the model name. If the model you're using is not working correctly out of the box, you can tweak various aspects of how model requests are constructed by providing your own ModelProfile (for behaviors shared among all model classes) or OpenAIModelProfile (for behaviors specific to `OpenAIChatModel`):

```python
from pydantic_ai import Agent, InlineDefsJsonSchemaTransformer
from pydantic_ai.models.openai import OpenAIChatModel
from pydantic_ai.profiles.openai import OpenAIModelProfile
from pydantic_ai.providers.openai import OpenAIProvider

model = OpenAIChatModel(
    'model_name',
    provider=OpenAIProvider(
        base_url='https://<openai-compatible-api-endpoint>.com', api_key='your-api-key'
    ),
    profile=OpenAIModelProfile(
        json_schema_transformer=InlineDefsJsonSchemaTransformer,  # Supported by any model class on a plain ModelProfile
        openai_supports_strict_tool_definition=False  # Supported by OpenAIModel only, requires OpenAIModelProfile
    )
)
agent = Agent(model)

```
