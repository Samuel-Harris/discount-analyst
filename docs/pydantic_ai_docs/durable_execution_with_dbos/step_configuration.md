## Step Configuration

You can customize DBOS step behavior, such as retries, by passing StepConfig objects to the `DBOSAgent` constructor:

- `mcp_step_config`: The DBOS step config to use for MCP server communication. No retries if omitted.
- `model_step_config`: The DBOS step config to use for model request steps. No retries if omitted.

For custom tools, you can annotate them directly with [`@DBOS.step`](https://docs.dbos.dev/python/reference/decorators#step) or [`@DBOS.workflow`](https://docs.dbos.dev/python/reference/decorators#workflow) decorators as needed. These decorators have no effect outside DBOS workflows, so tools remain usable in non-DBOS agents.
