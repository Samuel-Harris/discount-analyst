## Observability with Logfire

Temporal generates telemetry events and metrics for each workflow and activity execution, and Pydantic AI generates events for each agent run, model request and tool call. These can be sent to [Pydantic Logfire](../../logfire/) to get a complete picture of what's happening in your application.

To use Logfire with Temporal, you need to pass a LogfirePlugin object to Temporal's `Client.connect()`:

logfire_plugin.py

```python
from temporalio.client import Client

from pydantic_ai.durable_exec.temporal import LogfirePlugin, PydanticAIPlugin


async def main():
    client = await Client.connect(
        'localhost:7233',
        plugins=[PydanticAIPlugin(), LogfirePlugin()],
    )

```

By default, the `LogfirePlugin` will instrument Temporal (including metrics) and Pydantic AI and send all data to Logfire. To customize Logfire configuration and instrumentation, you can pass a `logfire_setup` function to the `LogfirePlugin` constructor and return a custom `Logfire` instance (i.e. the result of `logfire.configure()`). To disable sending Temporal metrics to Logfire, you can pass `metrics=False` to the `LogfirePlugin` constructor.
